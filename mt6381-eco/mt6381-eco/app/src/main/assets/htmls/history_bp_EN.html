<h4>
Blood Pressure (BP)</h4>
<p>
   Blood Pressure (BP) is the pressure exerted on the walls of blood vessels by the circulating blood. It is usually expressed in terms of the systolic pressure (maximum during one heart beat) over diastolic pressure (minimum in between two heart beats). Typical resting Blood Pressure in an adult is approximately 120 millimeters of mercury systolic, and 80 millimeters of mercury diastolic; represented as 120/80 mmHg. Systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressures are not static but undergo natural variations from one heartbeat to another and throughout the day. They change in response to stress, nutritional factors, caffiene, drugs, disease, and exercise.</p>
