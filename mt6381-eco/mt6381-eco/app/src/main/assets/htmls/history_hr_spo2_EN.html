<h4>
Heart Rate (HR)</h4>
<p>
    The HR value is represented by beats per minute (bpm). When resting, a normal HR range is between 50 to 100bpm. When doing exercise, your HR increases. For people with better physical fitness, the typical HR is lower when resting and exercising. As people become elderly, the maximum HR range also decreases.</p>

<h4>Peripheral (Capillary) Oxygen Saturation (SpO2)
</h4>
<p>
    SpO2 is an estimated value of blood oxygen level, which is normally between 95% &#126; 100%. When the SpO2 value is too low, this can imply respiratory or circulation system issues.</p>
